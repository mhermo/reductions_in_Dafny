This repository contains Dafny files that verify the correctness of various polynomial-time reductions between NP-complete decision problems.

Each file contains the corresponding proof of the reduction's correctness, except for the reduction from Dir_Ham to Undir_Ham, which includes only one direction of the proof.

Last used Dafny version in this work: 4.9.0

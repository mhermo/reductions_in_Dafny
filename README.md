Correctness of Problem Reductions Using Dafny

This repository contains Dafny files that verify the correctness of various polynomial-time reductions between NP-complete decision problems.

Each file contains the corresponding proof of the reduction's correctness, except for the case of Dir_Ham to Undir_Ham, which only presents one of the two directions of the reduction.

Last used Dafny version in this work: 4.8.1

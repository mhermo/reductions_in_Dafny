This repository contains Dafny files that verify the correctness of various polynomial-time reductions between NP-complete decision problems.

Each file contains a proof of the corresponding reduction's correctness, except for the reduction from Dir_Ham to Undir_Ham, for which only one direction of the proof is included.

The last Dafny version used in this work is 4.9.0
